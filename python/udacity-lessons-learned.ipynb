    "- Browse the raw data and make note of its unique needs and limitations. This can save time during EDA and help shape analysis.\n",
    "- I'm going to run into things I don't know how to do or things that throw errors. Do NOT get caught in a guessing-around loop. Instead, reason up from first principles. Start with a piece of paper and start connecting things from what I do know to what I need to know and then what spawns from there, eventually reasoning up to my goal.\n",

    "- Donâ€™t write the narrative of the report while conducting the analysis. Use a minimal outline and notes. Once everything is ready build up the notebook as a report.\n",
    "- At different stages during wrangling and analysis, confirm things are working as expected either programmatically within the notebook or by exporting and viewing csv files."

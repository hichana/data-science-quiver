Magnetic resonance imaging may be considered to be the gold standard for detecting anterior inferior tibio-fibula ligament (AITFL) injury but is expensive, not readily available and only provides information during static positioning.

In addition the relative convenience, accessibility, safety and the low cost of ultrasound examination makes it a potentially popular imaging modality. Dynamic ultrasound may allow the functional stability of the ankle joint to be determined providing valuable information to guide treatment.

These values will aid in the diagnosis and may aid management decisions for high ankle sprain injury.</p>\n",

Ultrasound examination of both ankles was performed in all subjects by an experienced musculoskeletal radiologist (XX) and reviewed by a sports physician, using a 7.5-12 MHz linear transducer HDI 5000 SonoCT ATL (Philips, Andover, Massachusetts). Ultrasound images were obtained to visualize the syndesmosis landmarks, recorded and printed. The printed images were re-evaluated by the primary investigators.

Anterior, lateral and medial compartments were evaluated to exclude previously injured joints. The syndesmosis was imaged in the transverse plane via the anterior approach. The AITFL was visualized for continuity and contour at 1cm proximal to the joint line just above the distal tibial anterior cortex where the ligament is thickest. (Figure \n",

The measurements were taken on the U.S monitor and then re-evaluated on a hardcopy print. Each measurement was repeated and was averaged if a difference was documented.</p>\n",

The mean height was 173 cm (range 149&#8211;192), mean TTMM (tibial tuberosity to medial malleolus) length was 35cm (range 30-41cm) and the right leg was dominant in 83% of the subjects.

We considered active patients those who trained or participated in sports for more than 15 hours per week, typically professional athletes. Non-active patients were those who participated in sports at a social level or not at all. Height and calf length were also measured. &#8220;Calf length&#8221; was measured from medial malleolus to tibial tuberosity.</p>\n",

    "#          <p>In this study we have established that the normal tibio-fibular clear space is 3.78mm and that the mean widening of the tibio-fibular clear space is 0.3mm for ER-N and 0.44mm for ER-IR on dynamic ultrasound examination. In neutral position a measurement of 5.06 mm (Std. Dev. 0.64, 3.78+2SD=5.06) would be 2 standard deviations above the mean. This suggests a measurement greater than this should be suspected as abnormal. Females had increased clear space opening with forced external rotation, with a significantly greater &#8220;widening ratio&#8221; of the AITFL to applied stress. This agrees with the literature as female subjects tend to be more flexible than males \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B7\">7</abbr></abbrgrp>. There was no correlation between clear space opening and activity, height or leg length. Those who participate in gymnastics and dance tend to have increased joint laxity, \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B8\">8</abbr></abbrgrp> however in this study sports activity was not shown to be a significant factor, although a trend was evident.</p>\n",
    "#          <p>Younger subjects showed higher absolute clear space opening measurements and stress opening than older subjects, a result which was evident in both genders. This finding is expected given the general increase in stiffness that occurs with aging \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B9\">9</abbr><abbr bid=\"B10\">10</abbr></abbrgrp>. We also found that activity, height or leg length did not correlate significantly with opening of the joint. That means that tall athletes, for an example, would not have a larger opening than younger non-active females.</p>\n",
    "#          <p>The results of a previously published study indicate that a dynamic ultrasound examination can accurately diagnose a syndesmotic injury in cases of latent (not evidenced on radiograph films) grade 3 AITFL sprains \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr></abbrgrp>. Similar to other ligament injuries, injuries to the AITFL are graded based on stretch (grade1), partial tear (grade 2), or complete rupture (grade 3) \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B11\">11</abbr></abbrgrp>. Complete rupture of the AITFL is described as a stage one syndesmotic injury, which with additional force may cause the talus to spread the tibia and fibula apart. This can subsequently damage the posterior aspect of the syndesmosis (PITFL and transverse ligament) and cause a stage three injury \n",

    "#          <p>One of the strengths of this study is that it provides information regarding the width of the anterior tibio-fibular clear space in a neutral unloaded position and also provides dynamic assessment of the opening of this space with the application of a deforming force. We believe this is the first study to record syndesmotic opening dynamically in normal subjects.</p>\n",
    "#          <p>One of the features of this presented method is reproducibility. Ultrasound examination is operator dependent and requires regular practice to be familiar with localized imaging and normal values. We have used a published standardized technique to measure the width of the anterior tibio-fibular clear space \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr></abbrgrp>. In this series one experienced radiologist (XX) performed the US examinations accompanied by a muscloskeletal ultrasound trained sports physician (YY) in an attempt to minimize intra-observer error. Prior to the initiation of the study, reproducibility was verified by two other musculoskeletal radiologists in our institute. The technique of ultrasound measurement of the anterior clear space was quick to learn and was considered to be reproducible, comparable with MRI and shown to have an accuracy of 89-100% for AITFL injury \n",
    "#                 <abbrgrp><abbr bid=\"B4\">4</abbr></abbrgrp>. By recording the values of syndesmotic opening in normal subjects we have provided normal reference values, which can assist less experienced musculoskeletal ultrasonographers. It is important that all measurements are taken at the same level above the ankle joint in order to standardize the relation between N, ER and IR positions. Even if the probe is placed a few millimeters higher, the absolute clear space opening measurement in neutral position might be increased but dynamic evaluation will keep the same relationships.</p>\n",
    "#          <p>Another potential weakness is the lack of a standardized deforming force to recreate the opening of the syndesmosis. As this was a clinical study on live subjects the syndesmosis was not tested to failure but merely the width at maximal opening was determined. External rotation was performed until a firm recognizable end point was reached. Error was minimized by the same examiner applying a similar rotational force, and appreciating the same firm end point from neutral dorsiflexion/plantarflexion in each case.</p>\n",
    "#          <p>Age groups compared in this study were under and over 40 years of age. We have chosen 40years as a cutoff age between young and older group as most of our study subjects fell into these two main groups. We had one cluster around 20&#8211;30 years of age, which usually stand for the population who tend to suffer from syndesmosis injuries, and another cluster around the 50 years of age. We had very few subjects between 35 to 45 years of age, and no one at that exact age.</p>\n",
    "#          <p>The kinematic biomechanics of the distal tibio-fibular syndesmosis are subtle and are coupled with the ankle joint. With ankle dorsiflexion the talus rotates about 5 degrees externally about it&#8217;s axis in dorsiflexion and internally with plantarflexion \n",
